The proposed improvements are organized into phases, allowing for incremental
delivery and validation. The first phase focuses on critical security and
core functionality, ensuring a secure and feature-complete base system.

Subsequent phases add advanced features, integrations, and optimizations
that will make this a world-class scientific project management solution.

Immediate Next Steps:
1. Review and prioritize improvements with stakeholders
2. Address critical security concerns
3. Complete missing module views
4. Fix identified bugs and technical debt
5. Implement Phase 1 improvements

With proper investment and execution, this system can become the leading
open-source scientific project management solution for research institutions
worldwide.
